# generic-type-functions
Type-level functions (type families) on the generic type representation that
approximate familiar term-level functions.

The type families take defunctionalization symbols that use phadej's
[defun](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/defun-core) library.

Too abstract to be of much use, but here it is all the same.
