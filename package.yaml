# useful extensions to know about, but which should be specified on-demand
#
# UndecidableInstances:
#   required for type class wizardry
#   generally only enable if you were expecting to & compilation fails without
# AllowAmbiguousTypes:
#   often goes hand in hand with TypeApplications-heavy code
#   enabling on demand brings attention to the sort of functions to expect
# StarIsType:
#   may need to enable if you're working with old code that uses `Int :: *`
